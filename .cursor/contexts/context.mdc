Generate a React + TypeScript + Tailwind page for **Today's Appointments & Queue**.

### Requirements

- Component name: `TodayAppointmentsPage`.

- Layout:
  - Header with title: "Today's Appointments"
  - Two main sections (responsive):
    - Left: list/table of appointments for today.
    - Right: "Queue View" showing status in a more visual way (for receptionist).

- Data:
  - Fetch from `GET /api/v1/appointments/today`.
  - Each appointment item includes:
    - id
    - patientName
    - dentistName
    - startTime
    - endTime
    - status (BOOKED, ARRIVED, IN_TREATMENT, DONE, NO_SHOW, CANCELLED)
    - chairNumber (optional)

- Features:

  1. **Filter by dentist & status**
     - Dropdown to filter by dentist (e.g. "All dentists", "Dr. A", "Dr. B").
     - Dropdown or pills to filter by status.

  2. **Appointment table**
     - Columns: time range, patientName, dentistName, chairNumber, status, actions.
     - Action button to change status (e.g. BOOKED → ARRIVED → IN_TREATMENT → DONE).
     - On status change, call `PATCH /api/v1/appointments/:id/status` with the new status and optimistically update UI.

  3. **Queue view (right side)**
     - Group appointments by status:
       - BOOKED / ARRIVED at the top
       - IN_TREATMENT in the middle
       - DONE at the bottom
     - Display them as cards with patientName + time + dentistName.

- UX:
  - Show loading and error states.
  - Use color tags or badges for each status (e.g. green for DONE, yellow for ARRIVED, red for NO_SHOW).
  - UI should adapt to small screens (stack sections vertically on mobile).

### What to output

1. Full `TodayAppointmentsPage` React component with hooks and Tailwind styling.
2. TypeScript types for `Appointment`.
3. Helper function or small mapping from status → Tailwind color classes.
4. Example of the API calls using `fetch`.
